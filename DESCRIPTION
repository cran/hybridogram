Description: Using hybrid data, this package created a vividly colored hybrid heat map.
    The input is two files which are auto-selected.
    The first file has three columns, the first two for pairs of species,
    with the third column for the hybrid experiment code (an integer).
    The second file is a list of code and their descriptions in two 
    columns. The output is a figure showing the hybrid heat map with a color legend.
